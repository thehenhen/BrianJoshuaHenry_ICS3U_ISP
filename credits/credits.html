                    <h2><b>Joshua Wang</b></h2> 
                    <p>(jojothewarrior)</p>
                    <p>Meet Joshua Wang, the Java-slinging, web-devving machine! This coding wizard is a true master of the art of programming, and he's not afraid to show it. He can whip up a web application faster than you can say "JavaScript", and he aspires to have a portfolio of mobile apps and games that would make even Mark Zuckerberg jealous.

                        <br><br>But don't let his coding skills fool you, Joshua is more than just a nerd who spends all day staring at a computer screen. He's also a master of dad jokes, terrible puns, and dad jokes about terrible puns. So if you ever need a break from all the serious coding talk, just ask Joshua to tell you a joke about a SQL query.
                        
                        <br><br>When it comes to work, Joshua is all business. He's the type of developer who will stay up all night to fix a bug, just so he can get that perfect "deployment complete" notification in the morning. But don't worry, he always makes sure to fuel his coding marathon with enough caffeine and snacks to keep him going.
                        
                        <br><br>But perhaps Joshua's greatest strength is his ability to communicate with clients. He's able to explain the most complex technical jargon in a way that even your grandma would understand. So if you're ever in need of a web developer who can code circles around the competition, and make you laugh at the same time, Joshua Wang is the man for the job.

                    <h2><b>Henry Zhang</b></h2>
                    <p>(earlydrill)</p>
                    <p>Meet Henry Zhang, a man who has devoted his life to mastering the art of programming using C++ and web development. Despite his proficiency in his field, he struggles to find fulfillment in his work and instead turns to the simple and meaningless distraction of playing "Cookie Clicker" in his free time. He finds himself feeling empty and unfulfilled, unable to shake the feeling that there must be more to life than this.

                        <br><br>He spends his days hunched over a computer screen, typing away at lines of code, trying to find solace in his work but always coming up short. He finds himself going through the motions, completing projects without any sense of accomplishment or satisfaction.
                        
                        <br><br>In his free time, he turns to the game as a way to numb the feelings of emptiness and inadequacy. He gets lost in the monotonous clicking, trying to distract himself from the nagging feeling that something is missing.
                        
                        <br><br>But Henry is determined not to let this feeling define him. He begins to explore new hobbies and interests, seeking out activities that bring him joy and fulfillment. He starts to touch grass and make friends, using his skills to make a positive impact in his community. He also starts to mentor young programmers, passing on his knowledge and experience to the next generation.
                        
                        <br><br>Through these new endeavors, Henry discovers that true fulfillment comes from making a difference in the world and helping others. He begins to find purpose in his work and his life, and starts to let go of his obsession with the meaningless game. With time, he realizes that there is more to life than what he initially thought and start to live a more fulfilling life. </p>

                    <h2><b>Brian Song</b></h2>
                    <p>(bsfaxious)</p>
                    <p>Introducing Brian, a man whose life is a never-ending cycle of coding in Java, web development and procrastination. He is a master of his craft, able to create intricate web applications with ease, but his personal life is a different story. He is a solitary figure, holed up in his apartment, lost in the virtual world of "League of Legends."

                        <br><br>As the clock ticks, Brian can be found frantically typing away at his keyboard, trying to meet a deadline for a project, but as soon as the clock strikes, he's back to playing his favorite game. His days blend together, and it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.
                        
                        <br><br>He's a man on the edge, teetering between the worlds of code and fantasy, never fully committing to either one. He's a man with a gift, but he's also a man with a curse. He's a man who's always searching for something more, but never quite finding it.
                        
                        <br><br>Brian is a man who's running from himself, but maybe, just maybe, he'll find a way to break free from his cycle and discover the life he's always wanted.</p>
