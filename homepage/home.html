            <h2>What is this website?</h2>
            <p>
                Rather than re-inventing the wheel by creating yet another website that explains competitive programming concepts in detail,
                this website instead focuses on visualizing the concepts. For all the topics that are covered, we have interactive and visual 
                demonstrations that will illustrate rather than explain them. Although we do not go deep into the details of exactly how the
                implementation of the code looks like, we did leave some links to articles and practice problems to ensure that you really
                understand the concepts well.

        <div id="section-3" class="title-section">
            <h2>What lessons are covered in this website?</h2>
            <p>
                So far, this website covers six topics, not necessarily ranging from the easiest difficulty to the hardest. Each of these six 
                data structures / algorithms are quite commonly applicable and anybody who is interested in competitive programming should 
                have them under their belt. This website is also subject to expansion in the future if Google ever purchases it.

        <div id="section-4" class="title-section">
            <h2>Why care about competitive programming?</h2>
            <p>
                If you're one of the people who are offended by the words "competitive programming", let us convince you in this paragraph why
                competitive programming, for what it's worth, is surprisingly interesting and useful. Firstly, it really helps you solidify
                your knowledge behind basic programming concepts, as it wires your brain to literally think like a computer. While you may
                already be familiar with all the functions and algorithms that you rely on when making a project, learning competitive
                programming actually analyzes how these functions work, and it teaches you to consider efficiency and accuracy. There's 
                no reason not to discover all these interesting algorithms designed by computer scientists and learn how they work, while also
                practicing your problem-solving skills along the way.
